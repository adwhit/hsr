## Quickstart

This is a very bare-bones server/client, defined in the spec `quickstart.yaml`.

Make sure you're using an up-to-date nightly, then `cargo run` to launch a basic demo.

It will start a simple server in one thread, access it through a client, print the result and exit.

Amazed, impressed? Then, take a look at the code!
