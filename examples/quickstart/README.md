## Quickstart

This is a very bare-bones server/client to get you up and running.

Execute `cargo run` to launch a basic demo.

It will start a simple server in one thread, access it through a client, print the result and exit.

Amazed, impressed? Then, take a look at the code!

* The API is specified in `quickstart.yaml`
* The API is generated in `build.rs`
* The server implementation is `src/main.rs`
